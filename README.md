Project Overview :
The Weather Forecast Application is a web-based project developed to provide real-time weather information for any city entered by the user. The app fetches live data from a weather API and displays key details like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions in a simple and user-friendly interface.

This project focuses purely on frontend technologies and demonstrates my ability to build practical, responsive, and interactive applications using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Objective :
The objective of this application was to build a simple, useful tool that allows users to check the weather of any location quickly. The project also served as a way to practice integrating APIs with frontend development and handling JSON data dynamically in JavaScript.

Tech Stack Used:
HTML was used to structure the layout of the application.
CSS was applied for styling and responsive design, ensuring the interface is clean and attractive.
JavaScript was used to handle the core logic, fetch data from the weather API, and update the UI dynamically.
OpenWeatherMap API (or any similar weather API) was used to fetch live weather data.

Features Implemented :
Search functionality that allows users to enter a city name and get weather updates.
Display of temperature, weather condition, and humidity in a neat card format.
Dynamic updates of weather information based on user input.
Error handling for invalid or empty city searches.
Responsive design ensuring usability across desktop and mobile screens.

Why These Technologies Were Used :
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were chosen as the project is purely frontend-based.
JavaScript was specifically important for integrating the weather API and updating the DOM dynamically without page reloads.
CSS was used to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing layout.
The weather API was integrated to make the app practical and real-time instead of working with static data.

My Role in the Project :
I independently designed and developed the entire Weather Forecast Application. This included creating the UI with HTML and CSS, writing the JavaScript logic to call the API, and displaying the results dynamically. I also implemented basic error handling to improve user experience.

Learning Outcomes :
This project improved my skills in working with APIs and handling JSON data using JavaScript. I gained practical experience in making HTTP requests from the frontend and dynamically updating the DOM. I also strengthened my knowledge of responsive design and frontend application structuring.
